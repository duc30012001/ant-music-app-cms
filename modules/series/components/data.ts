  <p><i><strong>Oggy and the Cockroaches</strong></i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language">French</a>:
    <i><strong>Oggy et les Cafards</strong></i>) is a French <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animated_television_series">animated television series</a> created by <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Yves_Raimbaud">Jean-Yves Raimbaud</a> for <a

        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xilam">Xilam Animation</a>. The series chronicles the exploits and
    adventures of Oggy, a blue cat whose life is constantly interrupted by three cockroaches ‚Äì Dee Dee, Marky, and Joey
    respectively ‚Äì who love to cause mischief within his home. The show employs <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_comedy">silent comedy</a>: characters either do not speak or use
    unintelligible vocalizations and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestures">gestures</a>. The show premiered
    in September 1998 on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_3">France 3</a>, and later expanded
    internationally. The series ended in January 2019, having released seven seasons in over two decades.
</p>
<p>In September 2020, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reboot_(fiction)">reboot</a> series was announced,
    entitled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oggy_and_the_Cockroaches:_Next_Generation"><i>Oggy and the

    worldwide on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix">Netflix</a> on 28 July 2022. Although it differs
    noticeably from the original in terms of its visuals and tone, <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulli">Gulli</a> labels it as <i>Oggy</i>'s eighth season.</p>
<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<p>Oggy, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism">anthropomorphic</a> cat, would prefer to spend his
    days watching television and eating but is continually pestered by three roaches: Joey, Marky and Dee Dee. The
    cockroaches' slapstick mischief ranges from plundering Oggy's refrigerator to hijacking the train he just boarded.
    In many situations, Oggy is also helped by Jack, who is more violent and short-tempered than him and is also annoyed
    by the cockroaches. Bob, a short-tempered bulldog, also appears in the show and is Oggy's neighbor.</p>

    episode was officially posted online, in 2016). In the second season, "Space Sailors" has a gag where the
    cockroaches greet Etno (in the aliens' now-flooded house), as they row by. Oggy, the cockroaches and Jack appear as
    drawings in "Doodle", and Oggy and Monica make a cameo in the episode "The Alien Show".<sup>[</sup><a

<h3><strong>Main</strong></h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Oggy</strong> is a cat with a light blue body, green eyes, red nose, grey tummy and white feet. Oggy
        also has a black "cap" (shaped to include his ears) over the top of his head. Oggy usually spends his time
        either watching TV or doing housework, when he's not chasing the cockroaches. Despite the constant mayhem caused
        by the cockroaches, Oggy has developed a sort of <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love%E2%80%93hate_relationship">love‚Äìhate relationship</a> with them,
        having lived with them for a long time. Whenever he finds himself alone in his house, he will eventually begin
        to miss the cockroaches along with their pranks (as seen in the episode "Priceless Roaches" and "So
        Lonely"/"Alone at last") followed by nothing interesting happening in his life. According to executive producer
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_du_Pontavice">Marc du Pontavice</a> and <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_Info">France Info</a>, Oggy was named after punk rock musician <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iggy_Pop">Iggy Pop</a><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oggy_and_the_Cockroaches#cite_note-5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> and the rock
        album <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rise_and_Fall_of_Ziggy_Stardust_and_the_Spiders_from_Mars">The
            Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars</a>.<a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oggy_and_the_Cockroaches#cite_note-6"><sup>[6]</sup></a><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oggy_and_the_Cockroaches#cite_note-7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> In the first
        three seasons, Oggy, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cat">his <i>Tom and Jerry</i>
            counterpart</a> was the main punching bag in the series, though that was phased out in the fourth and fifth
        seasons. He also has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_heights">fear of heights</a>, as shown in
        "The Rise &amp; the Fall"/"Vertigo" ‚Äì however, it only applied for Jack's construction site.
    </li>
    <li><strong>The Cockroaches</strong> are a trio of cockroaches named Dee Dee, Marky and Joey (who are implied to be
        named after members of the rock band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ramones">The Ramones</a>), who
        love playing tricks on Oggy and the other characters, like Jack. However, if the cats left, they would miss each
        other, as seen in "Moving Out". The cockroaches have wide heads, vibrantly-colored sclerae with long, pointy
        black noses and black feet. They also have black "caps" with their antennae, like Oggy.<ul>
            <li><strong>Dee Dee</strong> is the youngest cockroach with a dark blue body, orange head and green eyes.
                Always hungry, his appetite sometimes reaches insane proportions, often resulting in the consumption of
                larger animals or other things that would otherwise be inedible (such as <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyena">hyenas</a> in one case and, due to the effects of a
                poisonous mushroom in another case, an insect; other instances include the fish on the wallpaper in
                "Oggy's Clone"/"Oggy's Costume" and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clownfish">clownfish</a> in
                "Scuba Diving"). He is known to like opera in "Night at the Opera", wanting to publicly perform
                on-stage. Sometimes it is shown that his feet are so foul-smelling that the juice they produce is toxic
                and can melt objects, as seen in "Caught in a Trap"/"High Security Fridge". He is named after bassist <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dee_Dee_Ramone">Dee Dee Ramone</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Marky</strong> is the tallest cockroach with a silver body, green head and pink eyes (originally
                red). Although Marky originally used to love causing mischief just like Dee Dee and Joey, he has grown
                to be more laid-back as the series progressed and has a generic role. In most episodes, he is shown with
                Dee Dee as his partner-in-crime. He sometimes is a hopeless romantic (as seen in "Jealousy" and "Baby
                Doll"), and his hobbies consist of dating puppets and reading books (which are never shown). He also has
                bad breath as revealed in "It's a Small World"/"Itsy-Bitsy Oggy". While his eye color changed, they turn
                red again at one point in "Teleportation". He is named after drummer <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marky_Ramone">Marky Ramone</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Joey</strong> is the smallest cockroach with a purple-pink body, <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterochromia_iridum">pink right eye (originally red), a yellow
                    left eye</a>, and a lavender head. Even though he is the shortest roach in the group, he is the most
                intelligent, always being the brain for their plans ‚Äì but is sometimes forced to go alone, because Marky
                and Dee Dee often think that his ideas are stupid. He also loves money (which is shown in several
                episodes), but his efforts always fall short, usually ending with him getting swatted or beaten up. He
                is named after lead singer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Ramone">Joey Ramone</a>.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Recurring</strong></h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Jack</strong> is a cat with an olive green body, yellow eyes, red nose, pale pink stomach, and white
        feet. In contrast to Oggy, he is more short-tempered, violent, and arrogant than him. He often finds himself
        building huge machinery, such as roach-catching contraptions, and is very interested in <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics">physics</a> and <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry">chemistry</a> (that is, the more explosive parts of it),
        though this has been phased out in later seasons. Jack has an excellent relationship with Oggy, as he cares
        about him a lot, especially in the episode "Happy Birthday" where he tries to stop Oggy from <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committing_suicide">committing suicide</a>. Jack mostly visits and
        sleeps at Oggy's house, and owns a green jeep; in which he and Oggy go for a variety of journeys and in mundane
        cases, for trips to the beach or going fishing. He is sometimes seen trying to propose to Monica, but the
        cockroaches' pranks always stop it. In one episode ("Don't Rock the Cradle"/"Oggy the Babysitter"), Jack and
        Monica seem to have a baby together and ask Oggy to babysit their child. In "Just Married", Jack plans to get
        married to a poodle, but it got cancelled at the end due to the cockroaches sneaking in and causing trouble.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Bob</strong> is a fierce brown <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulldog">bulldog</a> and Oggy's
        neighbor, who has severe anger issues with him ‚Äì especially when Oggy, Jack or the roaches do something that
        accidentally crushes Bob, shaves his fur or destroys his house, with him proceeding to pummel Oggy or Jack
        off-screen. Despite this, he has some sort of friendship with them, as notably seen in some episodes like
        "Olivia", "Steamed Out", "Oggy Splits Hairs", "Back To The Past", etc. Even though Bob is tough, he also has a
        comically sensitive side, as shown in "Oggy's Teddy Bear", where it's also revealed he's a toy collector. In
        addition, Bob also works as a police officer in several episodes. However, in one episode ("Back To School"), he
        was presented as a teacher to Oggy and Jack.</li>
    <li><strong>Olivia</strong> is a white cat with a yellow bow on her head who debuts in the fourth season's first
        episode, and becomes Oggy's girlfriend. She is happy-go-lucky and polite, being fond of nature and finding any
        sort of opportunity for fun. In spite of her optimistic outlooks, though she is aware of the cockroaches'
        mischief; so she stops them when they are around by using some aggressive methods (however, in "Oggy and the
        Not-So-Smart Bracelet", she outright retaliates at Marky). Olivia also cares a lot about her appearance, as seen
        in the episode "Olivia's Pimple", where she refuses to leave her house when she saw a pimple on her face. In
        "Oggy Is Getting Married!", as the episode title implies, Olivia and Oggy get married after a trip to <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice">Venice</a>, Italy and she currently is Oggy's wife. However,
        their life after said marriage is not shown later in the series.</li>
